# ViS4mer

This is an official pytorch implementation of our ECCV 2022 paper [Long Movie Clip Classification with State-Space Video Models](https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.01692). In this repository, we provide PyTorch code for training and testing our proposed ViS4mer model. ViS4mer is an efficient video recognition model that achieves state-of-the-art results on several long-range video understanding bechmarks such as [LVU](https://arxiv.org/abs/2106.11310), [Breakfast] (https://serre-lab.clps.brown.edu/resource/breakfast-actions-dataset/), and [Coin](https://coin-dataset.github.io).
